    A record is an ordered group of named data.  Unlike tuples, a record type must
    be defined before it can be used.  You can decompose a record using a pattern,
    and you can access individual fields by name using dot-syntax.  In other
    functional programming languages, you can only access fields by pattern
    decomposition, so it's useful to get into the habit of using that instead of dot-syntax.

    Before you skip over to the tests, take a look at the record definitions under this comment.
